# TypeScript Error Fix Applied

This branch contains the fix for TypeScript compilation error that was preventing Docker build from completing.

## Fixed Issue:
- src/services/streamingService.ts(799,62): error TS18046: 'error' is of type 'unknown'

## Solution Applied:
- Added proper type checking for error.message access
- Used error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error' pattern

## Status:
✅ TypeScript compilation now passes
✅ Docker build should complete successfully
✅ All enhanced YouTube fallback strategies preserved

The fix has been applied directly to main branch.
